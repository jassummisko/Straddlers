Requires [Yuescript](https://yuescript.org/), [Dianchi](https://github.com/jassummisko/Dianchi), [unicorndecode](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/unicorndecode) and [ftcsv](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/ftcsv).
You must provide the [phoible.csv](https://github.com/phoible/dev/blob/master/data/phoible.csv) file yourself in the folder 'data'. If you wish to create your own `cleanFeatures.csv`, then you must also add [phoible-segments-features.tsv](https://github.com/phoible/dev/blob/master/raw-data/FEATURES/phoible-segments-features.tsv) in the folder `data`, renamed to `features.tsv` before running `cleanUpData.yue` with Python 3 and the library `unidecode` installed on your system. Keep in mind that in most cases, you do not need to do this, and that `cleanUpData.yue` is terribly inefficient and was written as a quick-and-dirty ad-hoc solution to a formatting problem.

It is recommended to compile the `.yue` files to `.lua` (this can be done automatically with [yue](https://yuescript.org/)'s built in `-w` option, or using a build system such as [tup](https://gittup.org/tup/).)
